# mmspheatpump

An application for [Emoncms](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms) that helps review experiments with a heat pump.

It has been designed for an air source heat pump attached to a single-zone water-based space heating system such as radiators or under-floor heating. It should work well with a system that has an [MMSP](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/key-term-explained/metering-and-monitoring-service-package-mmsp).

It was inspired by "[My Heat Pump](https://github.com/emoncms/app/tree/master/apps/OpenEnergyMonitor/myheatpump)" but the application logic comes from a home-grown web app that [David Bowen](mailto:david@myforest.com) started writing in November 2019.
